        <p>The European Commission has determined that TikTok breached EU advertising transparency laws, potentially leading to a fine of up to 6% of its annual global turnover. This preliminary finding is part of an investigation launched in February 2024. The Commission criticized TikTok for not providing an advertisement library, which is essential for transparency regarding ad content, targeted users, and sponsors. This lack of transparency could hinder the assessment of election integrity, particularly in light of a separate ongoing inquiry into TikTok's potential role in election interference in Romania, where foreign influence was suspected. The Commission emphasized TikTok’s obligations under the Digital Services Act while TikTok has expressed disagreement with some interpretations and is reviewing the findings. The company is currently evaluating its advertising policies and addressing other compliance issues, including child safety and algorithm impacts. <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/15/tiktok-breached-eu-advertising-transparency-laws-commission-says target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Researchers from MIT, Harvard, and the Broad Institute have developed an advanced machine-learning model called PUPS that accurately predicts the location of virtually any protein within human cells, even those that have not been previously studied. This innovation utilizes a dual model: a protein sequence model to understand the protein's properties and a computer vision model to analyze cell images. The research addresses the challenge of identifying over 70,000 proteins in human cells, which is cumbersome and costly when done manually.

PUPS’s ability to localize proteins at the single-cell level could significantly enhance disease diagnosis and drug discovery by providing clearer insights into protein functionality and localization. It improves upon existing models by generalizing across unseen protein and cell line combinations, minimizing prediction errors. Future enhancements aim to include multi-protein interaction predictions and application in living human tissues. This work stands to transform biological research and therapeutic applications. <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-predict-protein-location-within-human-cell-using-ai-0515 target="_blank">link</a></p>

Pursuing dual master's degrees, Kyaw recently developed Curator AI, a platform that optimizes online furniture shopping using AI to provide personalized recommendations based on room dimensions and existing furniture. He also created Estimate, which utilizes AR and AI for accurate cost estimations in home renovations. Both projects highlight a push towards intuitive consumer experiences. Additionally, Kyaw is working on sustainable building practices through projects like Unlog, which aims to utilize complete logs for construction, and BendShelters, which creates modular bamboo structures for refugees. His research focuses on merging technology with design for practical applications that address social issues, demonstrating a commitment to innovation with positive societal impact. <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2025/alexander-htet-kyaw-merging-design-computer-science-in-creative-ways-0428 target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>In a commencement speech at Temple University, Steven Levy addresses concerns among new graduates that artificial intelligence (AI) may hinder their career prospects. He emphasizes that while AI is rapidly advancing, it cannot replicate the unique human qualities that liberal arts education fosters, such as empathy, creativity, and the ability to forge genuine connections. Levy reassures graduates that they possess a "superpower"—their humanity—which adds immense value to their work, especially in roles involving human interaction and interpretation of human behavior. He acknowledges the potential job losses due to AI but believes new opportunities will arise that AI cannot fill. Levy encourages graduates to embrace their human side and leverage AI as a tool for efficiency while prioritizing the heart and essence of their work. His message culminates in the affirmation of their identity as humans, capable of impactful contributions in an evolving job market. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-commencement-speech-artificial-intelligence/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>MIT researchers have discovered that vision-language models (VLMs), which are increasingly used in medical imaging and other areas, struggle to accurately process negation words like “no” and “not.” This limitation poses risks in critical applications such as medical diagnosis, where misinterpretation of negation could lead to incorrect conclusions. The study highlights that VLMs often perform at the level of a random guess when identifying negation in image captions. By creating a new dataset incorporating negation, researchers improved VLM performance by retraining these models, enhancing their ability to recognize missing elements in images and correcting prior inaccuracies. Despite these advances, the authors caution that VLMs still require thorough evaluation before widespread deployment in high-stakes scenarios, emphasizing the need for awareness of their limitations in understanding negation. <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2025/study-shows-vision-language-models-cant-handle-negation-words-queries-0514 target="_blank">link</a></p>
