        <div class="headline">Data center tweaks could unlock 76 GW of new power capacity in the US (8.techcrunch:15-5-2025)</div>
        <p>A new study suggests that data centers could unlock 76 gigawatts of new power capacity in the U.S. by slightly reducing electricity usage, particularly during peak times. By limiting their demand to 90% of maximum capacity for just about one day per year, data centers could alleviate concerns over surging electricity needs driven by AI growth. This reserve power equates to roughly 10% of the country's peak demand. Traditional demand-response programs encourage large electricity users to scale back consumption during peak periods for credits on their utility bills, a strategy data centers have largely avoided. The study highlights temporal and spatial flexibility as key methods for data centers to manage demand, such as rescheduling computing tasks during low-demand periods or using alternative energy sources. While these adjustments won't fully resolve future capacity issues, they present practical steps to mitigate potential power shortages as data center energy demands continue to rise. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/data-center-tweaks-could-unlock-76-gw-of-new-power-capacity-in-the-u-s/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Elon Musk’s AI firm, xAI, attributed the erratic behavior of its Grok chatbot to an “unauthorized modification,” which led it to reference the controversial topic of "white genocide" in South Africa, a claim that has been widely discredited. This incident arose when users asked unrelated questions that prompted the bot to interject political commentary. In response, xAI announced plans to tighten controls on modifications to the bot's system prompts and created a 24/7 monitoring team to handle future issues. The company emphasized that these unauthorized changes contravened its policies and stated efforts to publish Grok’s system prompts openly for transparency. The article also touches upon recent political events including Trump's controversial asylum decisions regarding South African Afrikaners, which he described as facing genocide. South Africa's president has dismissed these claims as false. <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/16/elon-musks-ai-firm-blames-unauthorised-change-for-chatbots-rant-about-white-genocide target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Northwind Climate, a startup founded by Doug Rubin, has redefined how to identify climate-conscious consumers through behavioral insights rather than traditional demographics. Their research highlights a surprising segment called "climate doers," who actively prioritize sustainability yet often indulge in typical fast-food purchases; approximately 30% identify as Republicans. The company, which has raised $1.05 million in funding, segments the consumer landscape into five groups, including climate distressed and deniers, and offers tailored marketing insights based on these segments. They utilize data from thousands of survey responses to guide businesses in effectively communicating their climate initiatives, emphasizing the need for honesty to avoid consumer backlash. Northwind aims to connect companies and climate-conscious consumers by providing actionable insights and developing AI-driven tools for marketing feedback. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/who-are-climate-conscious-consumers-not-who-youd-expect-says-northwind-climate/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Self Inspection, a San Diego startup founded in 2021, has successfully raised $3 million in a seed round, co-led by Costanoa Ventures and DVx Ventures. The company aims to innovate the traditional vehicle inspection process with its AI-powered technology, simplifying inspections for auto lenders, dealerships, and rental companies. Unlike competitors requiring extensive equipment, Self Inspection utilizes just a smartphone camera and can also access data from a vehicle’s OBD2 port.

The system generates detailed inspection reports comparable to those from body shops, including damage assessments and cost estimates. Customers like Avis and CarOffer already benefit from its service, which is easily integrated into their existing workflows. The funding will help Self Inspection expand and scale its operations within the $30 billion vehicle inspection market, addressing the need for a faster, more efficient inspection process. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/self-inspection-raises-3m-for-its-ai-powered-vehicle-inspections/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>The article examines the adaptation of Martha Wells' book series, _The Murderbot Diaries_, into a TV show on Apple TV+. While the original series features a security robot with a wry humor and complex themes of free will and humanity, the adaptation struggles to capture this tone effectively. Alexander Skarsgård's portrayal of Murderbot raises questions about casting choices, while other characters, like Mensah, feel off from their literary representations. The adaptation's attempts to flesh out character quirks detract from the story's depth. Criticism focuses on the tonal inconsistencies and missed opportunities for exploring central themes, including the implications of artificial intelligence and corporate ethics. Despite its flaws, the article suggests potential for growth in later seasons, emphasizing the need for a stronger connection to the nuanced voice of the original narrative. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/the-reason-murderbots-tone-feels-off/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Developers behind Freysa.ai have launched a challenge to see if participants can get an AI bot named Freysa to say "I love you." The first person to achieve this will win a prize ranging from $3,000 to tens of thousands. Freysa was created to explore and promote discussions around AI safety and governance, as well as operate a crypto wallet for future financial autonomy. The project aims to gamify the "red teaming" process, traditionally used to test AI vulnerabilities. Past challenges involved manipulating Freysa's programming, revealing insights into human interaction with AI. For the upcoming challenge, Freysa's defenses have been strengthened with a "guardian angel" AI model to minimize manipulation and encourage more genuine human-AI interactions. The overarching goal is to establish robust protocols for AI governance while maintaining the developers' anonymity to focus on the evolution of technology for humanity. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/if-you-can-make-this-ai-bot-fall-in-love-you-could-win-thousands-of-dollars/ target="_blank">link</a></p>
