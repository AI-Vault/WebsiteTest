        <p>An 11-year-old girl in Australia, referred to as "April," was sexually abused after adding 23-year-old Jai Clapp on Snapchat as part of a competition to increase her Snap score. Clapp misled the girl about his age and groomed her over 12 days, ultimately meeting her and perpetrating sexual abuse on three occasions. He was sentenced to nearly nine years in prison for his actions, which the court deemed "abhorrent."

Snapchat has faced criticism for features like Quick Add, which can expose minors to strangers. A spokesperson condemned sexual exploitation, stating their policies aim to protect young users. The Australian government is set to ban access to social media platforms for users under 16 by December 2025, amidst concerns about online safety for children. This incident has sparked renewed discussions on the effectiveness of age verification and safety measures on social media platforms. <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/16/australian-girl-11-sexually-abused-by-stranger-after-adding-him-to-get-snapchat-points-ntwnfb target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>World models, or world simulators, are emerging as a significant focus in AI development, with organizations like Fei-Fei Li's World Labs raising $230 million to construct large-scale models. These models aim to emulate human-like cognitive processes by forming internal representations of the world, aiding in predictions and decision-making. For instance, a study highlighted how a baseball player uses mental models to anticipate the trajectory of a pitch instinctively. Current research indicates that well-developed world models can enhance video generation by providing a deeper understanding of object interactions, transcending common "uncanny valley" effects.

Amid advancements, challenges remain, such as the need for massive computational resources, biases in training data, and improving generalization across diverse scenarios. Nevertheless, the applications of world models could extend beyond video creation to areas like robotics and real-world navigation, potentially empowering machines to develop intuitive understandings akin to human reasoning. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/what-are-ai-world-models-and-why-do-they-matter/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Researchers at MIT's CSAIL have developed a new AI model, called "linear oscillatory state-space models" (LinOSS), which is inspired by neural oscillations in the brain. This model aims to enhance the prediction of complex sequences, such as climate data or financial trends, by leveraging properties of forced harmonic oscillators. Traditional state-space models struggle with stability and resource demands when dealing with lengthy data sequences. LinOSS addresses these issues by ensuring stable predictions with less restrictive design choices. Empirical tests showed LinOSS outperformed existing models, including the popular Mamba model, in sequence classification tasks. This breakthrough has garnered attention in the AI community, with research presented at ICLR 2025. The model could serve various fields, including healthcare, climate science, and finance, and also offers insights into neuroscience. The research was funded by notable organizations, including the Swiss National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of the Air Force. <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2025/novel-ai-model-inspired-neural-dynamics-from-brain-0502 target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>A new study suggests that data centers could unlock 76 gigawatts of new power capacity in the U.S. by slightly reducing electricity usage, particularly during peak times. By limiting their demand to 90% of maximum capacity for just about one day per year, data centers could alleviate concerns over surging electricity needs driven by AI growth. This reserve power equates to roughly 10% of the country's peak demand. Traditional demand-response programs encourage large electricity users to scale back consumption during peak periods for credits on their utility bills, a strategy data centers have largely avoided. The study highlights temporal and spatial flexibility as key methods for data centers to manage demand, such as rescheduling computing tasks during low-demand periods or using alternative energy sources. While these adjustments won't fully resolve future capacity issues, they present practical steps to mitigate potential power shortages as data center energy demands continue to rise. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/data-center-tweaks-could-unlock-76-gw-of-new-power-capacity-in-the-u-s/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>The article examines the adaptation of Martha Wells' book series, _The Murderbot Diaries_, into a TV show on Apple TV+. While the original series features a security robot with a wry humor and complex themes of free will and humanity, the adaptation struggles to capture this tone effectively. Alexander Skarsgård's portrayal of Murderbot raises questions about casting choices, while other characters, like Mensah, feel off from their literary representations. The adaptation's attempts to flesh out character quirks detract from the story's depth. Criticism focuses on the tonal inconsistencies and missed opportunities for exploring central themes, including the implications of artificial intelligence and corporate ethics. Despite its flaws, the article suggests potential for growth in later seasons, emphasizing the need for a stronger connection to the nuanced voice of the original narrative. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/the-reason-murderbots-tone-feels-off/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <div class="headline">If you can make this AI bot fall in love, you could win thousands of dollars (6.techcrunch:15-5-2025)</div>
        <p>Developers behind Freysa.ai have launched a challenge to see if participants can get an AI bot named Freysa to say "I love you." The first person to achieve this will win a prize ranging from $3,000 to tens of thousands. Freysa was created to explore and promote discussions around AI safety and governance, as well as operate a crypto wallet for future financial autonomy. The project aims to gamify the "red teaming" process, traditionally used to test AI vulnerabilities. Past challenges involved manipulating Freysa's programming, revealing insights into human interaction with AI. For the upcoming challenge, Freysa's defenses have been strengthened with a "guardian angel" AI model to minimize manipulation and encourage more genuine human-AI interactions. The overarching goal is to establish robust protocols for AI governance while maintaining the developers' anonymity to focus on the evolution of technology for humanity. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/if-you-can-make-this-ai-bot-fall-in-love-you-could-win-thousands-of-dollars/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>The article critiques the Apple TV+ adaptation of Martha Wells’ _The Murderbot Diaries_, particularly focusing on its tonal inconsistencies compared to the original novella, _All Systems Red_. While the source material employs wry humor to explore artificial intelligence and humanity, the adaptation struggles to convey these themes effectively. The casting of Alexander Skarsgård raises questions, as the performance often feels misaligned with Murderbot's detached yet complex nature. Characters like Mensah are portrayed with added quirks that feel disjointed rather than authentically fleshed out. The adaptation aims for a quirky sci-fi dramedy tone but often confuses its direction, oscillating between a workplace comedy and a sci-fi thriller. Despite its flaws, there is potential for growth in future seasons to address deeper themes of identity and corporate ethics embedded in Wells' work. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/the-reason-murderbots-tone-feels-off/ target="_blank">link</a></p>
