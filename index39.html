                <b>Building better cities</b>
                <p>Clara Brenner and Julie Lein, who met at MIT's Sloan School, co-founded the Urban Innovation Fund (UIF), a VC firm focused on urban innovation. Starting with $24.5 million in 2016, UIF has invested in 64 startups aimed at addressing urban challenges such as transportation, public health, and education. The firm prioritizes businesses that combine social impact with potential high returns, often focusing on underrepresented founders. Brenner's background in commercial real estate and Lein's in political consulting complemented each other, allowing them to succeed in segments that traditional investors often overlook. Key investments include Electriphi, a software firm for EV charging, which was later acquired by Ford. The success of UIF has contributed to the growing acceptance of impact investing within mainstream venture capital. Brenner and Lein emphasize the importance of collaboration and trust in their partnership, which mirrors the values they seek in the startups they support.</p>
