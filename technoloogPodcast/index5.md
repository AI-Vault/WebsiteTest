 ## Guest Introduction
Randel Pelen, the director of Freedom Internet, joins the podcast to discuss his journey and insights into the internet service provider (ISP) industry. He reflects on his previous experience at Tweak and how he transitioned to leading Freedom Internet.

## Transition to Freedom Internet
Randel details how he was involved in launching Freedom Internet when it started five years ago. With his background in technology and ISP operations, he describes how he had sworn off returning to the consumer internet provider space. However, when the opportunity arose to help stabilize Freedom Internet after a key leadership change, he felt a calling to join.

## Market Dynamics
The conversation highlights the competitive landscape of the Dutch internet market, dominated by a few large players like KPN and Ziggo. Randel explains how smaller ISPs, including Freedom Internet, struggle due to the overwhelming market power of these giants. He discusses the challenges of pricing and market access, emphasizing how smaller ISPs are often at a disadvantage in both pricing power and network access.

## Pricing and Margins
Randel elaborates on the pricing model used by Freedom Internet, stating that they aim for reasonable rates without engaging in aggressive market buying strategies. He mentions the importance of understanding the cost of providing services, revealing the margins ISP operators face when purchasing network access from major providers.

## Challenges of Regulation
The lack of effective regulation in the ISP sector is a key issue discussed. Randel expresses concerns over current regulatory frameworks and their failure to ensure fair competition. He criticizes the market conditions that allow large companies to dominate pricing and service quality, which constricts options for consumers.

## Quality of Service and Technology
A significant portion of the conversation is dedicated to the quality of service provided by different ISPs. Randel argues for prioritizing better technology and customer service over merely competitive pricing. He highlights Freedom Internet's commitment to privacy and superior technical service, distinguishing it from larger providers.

## Censorship and Internet Freedom
Randel discusses a recent court case regarding censorship of news sites linked to the war in Ukraine. He stands firmly against censorship, arguing for the importance of access to information and the risks that come with allowing government-sanctioned censorship by ISPs.

## Future of freedom internet
The episode concludes with Randel advocating for the importance of smaller ISPs and urging consumers to support businesses like Freedom Internet that prioritize quality and ethics over mere cost-cutting practices. He provides a call to action for listeners to explore alternative ISPs that align with their values, particularly regarding privacy.

## Key Takeaways

- **Quality vs. Price**: Discusses the balance of providing excellent service without compromising on quality for low-cost offerings.

## Closing Remarks
