        <p>A new study suggests that data centers could unlock 76 gigawatts of new power capacity in the U.S. by slightly reducing electricity usage, particularly during peak times. By limiting their demand to 90% of maximum capacity for just about one day per year, data centers could alleviate concerns over surging electricity needs driven by AI growth. This reserve power equates to roughly 10% of the country's peak demand. Traditional demand-response programs encourage large electricity users to scale back consumption during peak periods for credits on their utility bills, a strategy data centers have largely avoided. The study highlights temporal and spatial flexibility as key methods for data centers to manage demand, such as rescheduling computing tasks during low-demand periods or using alternative energy sources. While these adjustments won't fully resolve future capacity issues, they present practical steps to mitigate potential power shortages as data center energy demands continue to rise. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/data-center-tweaks-could-unlock-76-gw-of-new-power-capacity-in-the-u-s/ target="_blank">link</a></p>
