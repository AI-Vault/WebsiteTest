            <p><strong>Building better cities</strong></p>
            <p>Clara Brenner and Julie Lein, who met at MIT's Sloan School, co-founded the Urban Innovation Fund (UIF), a VC firm focused on urban innovation. Starting with $24.5 million in 2016, UIF has invested in 64 startups aimed at addressing urban challenges such as transportation, public health, and education. The firm prioritizes businesses that combine social impact with potential high returns, often focusing on underrepresented founders. Brenner’s background in commercial real estate and Lein’s in political consulting complemented each other, allowing them to succeed in segments that traditional investors often overlook. Key investments include Electriphi, a software firm for EV charging, which was later acquired by Ford. The success of UIF has contributed to the growing acceptance of impact investing within mainstream venture capital. Brenner and Lein emphasize the importance of collaboration and trust in their partnership, which mirrors the values they seek in the startups they support. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/22/1114314/building-better-cities/">link</a></p>

            <p><strong>Google Is Using On-Device AI to Spot Scam Texts and Investment Fraud</strong></p>
            <p>Google is enhancing its on-device AI capabilities in the Google Messages app to combat digital fraud, particularly scams originating from text messages. With Americans losing over $16.6 billion to online scams last year, including significant amounts due to text message scams, Google aims to empower users with advanced Scam Detection features. This AI detects various types of scams, including cryptocurrency, impersonation, and technical support scams, flagging approximately 2 billion suspicious messages monthly without sharing user data with Google. The challenges include identifying complex scams, like long-term investment frauds that build trust over time. Google’s technology may eventually extend to phone call protections. This initiative reflects a broader industry trend where companies are leveraging AI to combat scams and protect consumers. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-on-device-ai-scam-texts/">link</a></p>

            <p><strong>Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal</strong></p>
            <p>Apple aims for carbon neutrality by utilizing eucalyptus tree farms in Brazil, a strategy that has sparked controversy among ecologists and local residents. The article explores the backdrop of rapid eucalyptus plantation expansion, driven by tech giants seeking carbon credits, which raise concerns about ecosystem impact in the ecologically rich Cerrado region. Critics label these monoculture groves as "green deserts," while proponents point to their capacity for rapid carbon absorption. Key themes include the tension between corporate sustainability efforts and ecological integrity, the complexities of carbon credits, and the broader implications of planting non-native species in a biodiverse savanna. Local voices express mixed feelings—some welcome the economic opportunities, while others worry about long-term environmental harm. The challenge of balancing immediate carbon offset needs against sustainable land management practices lies at the heart of this debate. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/24/1115751/apple-carbon-neutral-eucalyptus-tree-farm-brazil/">link</a></p>
