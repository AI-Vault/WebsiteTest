        <p>Researchers at MIT, in collaboration with Harvard University and the Broad Institute, have created a machine learning model that predicts the location of virtually any protein within a human cell, addressing a significant challenge in biomedical research. Traditional methods of identifying protein locations are labor-intensive and expensive, as there are over 70,000 types of proteins. The new model, named PUPS, leverages a protein language model and a computer vision model, enabling single-cell level localization and efficient exploration of uncharted protein-cell relationship spaces. PUPS predicts protein placement based on amino acid sequences and cell images, which aids in disease diagnosis and drug development. Its ability to generalize across proteins and cell lines makes it a promising tool for future research into protein interactions and disease mechanisms. Future enhancements aim to analyze protein-protein interactions and real-time predictions in live tissues. <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-predict-protein-location-within-human-cell-using-ai-0515 target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>An 11-year-old Australian girl, identified as “April,” was sexually abused after adding 23-year-old Jai Clapp on Snapchat through the Quick Add feature, which she used to compete for points with a friend. Clapp, posing as a 17-year-old, groomed her over 12 days and then abused her during three encounters at a park. He was later convicted of charges including digital and penile penetration, receiving an 8 years and 10 months prison sentence. Snapchat's parent company condemned the abuse as illegal and counter to their policies, emphasizing their aim to safeguard young users from strangers. In response to rising concerns about child exploitation on social media, Australia is anticipated to ban users under 16 from accessing Snapchat in December 2025. Concerns also persist about features like Quick Add, which could unintentionally facilitate predator access to minors. <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/16/australian-girl-11-sexually-abused-by-stranger-after-adding-him-to-get-snapchat-points-ntwnfb target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>A new study suggests that minor adjustments in data center operations could free up 76 gigawatts (GW) of electricity capacity in the U.S., a significant potential given the expected surge in electricity demand driven by AI growth. By curtailing power consumption to 90% of maximum capacity for about a day per year, particularly during peak demand, data centers could alleviate pressure on the power grid. Current strategies similar to this are employed in other sectors like shopping malls or factories. The study highlights that data centers can utilize temporal flexibility (rescheduling tasks) and spatial flexibility (redistributing computing loads) to respond to demand changes. Companies like Google and Enel X are already experimenting with demand response systems, utilizing batteries for backup power. While these strategies won't completely negate the need for new power sources, they provide a more manageable approach to cope with rising electricity needs. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/data-center-tweaks-could-unlock-76-gw-of-new-power-capacity-in-the-u-s/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>MIT researchers have identified that vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to interpret negation words such as "no" and "not," which can lead to inaccurate outputs, particularly in high-stakes fields like medical diagnostics. A study showed these models often performed at random guessing levels when tasked with understanding negation. The researchers developed a new dataset incorporating negation to help improve VLM performance, showing enhancements in retrieving images and answering questions involving negations. Despite these advances, the researchers caution that this is only a first step, and the existing shortcomings necessitate careful evaluation before deploying VLMs in critical applications. The research underscores the importance of addressing fundamental flaws in AI models to ensure reliability in real-world situations. <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2025/study-shows-vision-language-models-cant-handle-negation-words-queries-0514 target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>The article examines the tonal inconsistencies in the Apple TV+ adaptation of Martha Wells’ _The Murderbot Diaries_, focusing on the main character, a security robot named Murderbot. The series, which features Alexander Skarsgård, attempts to replicate the original's wry humor and exploration of AI, humanity, and free will but struggles to capture its essence. Key concerns include mischaracterizations of supporting roles and a disjointed narrative that confuses the tone, oscillating between workplace comedy and sci-fi thriller. While adaptations often face reader expectations, the adaptation’s failure to convey Murderbot's unique voice—its blend of humor and existential anxiety—detracts from its impact. Despite the potential for growth in future seasons, the critique suggests that the adaptation only scratches the surface of the original's deeper themes regarding corporate ethics and the nature of artificial intelligence. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/the-reason-murderbots-tone-feels-off/ target="_blank">link</a></p>
