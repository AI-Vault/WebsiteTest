        <p>Microsoft announced it will stop providing access to its Bing Search APIs to boost its focus on AI chatbots, ending a crucial resource for smaller search engines and developers. Scheduled for August 11, this shift affects mainly smaller clients while larger users, including DuckDuckGo, will retain access. The company framed this transition as a response to market demands for AI solutions, though many developers have criticized the new AI-powered system as insufficient. This decision follows increased pricing for the APIs and layoffs at Microsoft, raising concerns among clients about reliability and dependencies on the tech giant. The move may influence the competitive search landscape, especially as Google faces antitrust scrutiny that could require it to share its own search data. Ultimately, the changes signal a significant pivot in how search is accessed and utilized in the evolving digital ecosystem. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/bing-microsoft-api-support-ending/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <p>Google is enhancing its "Scam Detection" feature in the Google Messages app to combat digital fraud, including scams involving crypto, financial impersonation, and technical support. In the previous year, Americans lost $16.6 billion to online scams, with $470 million from text-message-related fraud. The new AI-powered tool, operating on-device to ensure privacy, now detects approximately 2 billion suspicious messages monthly. Google aims to address increasingly complex scams, such as "pig butchering" schemes that exploit personal ties over time. Other companies, like Meta and British telecom O2, are also deploying AI to counter scams, indicating a broader industry effort against digital fraud. Google is testing further expansion of scam detection into phone calls, showing its commitment to advancing security measures in communications. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-on-device-ai-scam-texts/ target="_blank">link</a></p>
