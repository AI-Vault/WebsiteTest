            <h2>Building better cities</h2>
            <p>Clara Brenner and Julie Lein, who met at MIT's Sloan School, co-founded the Urban Innovation Fund (UIF), a VC firm focused on urban innovation. Starting with $24.5 million in 2016, UIF has invested in 64 startups aimed at addressing urban challenges such as transportation, public health, and education. The firm prioritizes businesses that combine social impact with potential high returns, often focusing on underrepresented founders. Brenner’s background in commercial real estate and Lein’s in political consulting complemented each other, allowing them to succeed in segments that traditional investors often overlook. Key investments include Electriphi, a software firm for EV charging, which was later acquired by Ford. The success of UIF has contributed to the growing acceptance of impact investing within mainstream venture capital. Brenner and Lein emphasize the importance of collaboration and trust in their partnership, which mirrors the values they seek in the startups they support.</p>

            <h2>Driving business value by optimizing the cloud</h2>
            <p>Organizations are increasingly investing in cloud technologies to enhance business agility and innovation, with global spending on cloud infrastructure services reaching $84 billion in Q3 2024, reflecting a 23% year-on-year increase.

            <h2>Apple iPad Air M3 review: the premium tablet to beat</h2>
            <p>The Apple iPad Air M3 is evaluated as a premium tablet with impressive capabilities, including a powerful M3 chip, solid battery life, and high-quality display options (11in and 13in screens). Retaining the aluminum design and features like Touch ID, it boasts enhancements such as a revamped webcam that utilizes Centre Stage technology for video calls. The M3 processor offers a 10-20% speed improvement over its M2 predecessor, allowing for efficient performance with demanding applications. The tablet supports iPadOS 18.4, featuring multitasking options and AI tools not available in the base model. Despite its merits, the iPad's high price (starting from £599) and limitations in user support and display refresh rate may deter some users. While an excellent upgrade for those needing robust functionality, casual users watching media may find the standard iPad a more cost-effective choice.</p>

            <h2>Google Is Using On-Device AI to Spot Scam Texts and Investment Fraud</h2>
            <p>Google is enhancing its on-device AI capabilities in the Google Messages app to combat digital fraud, particularly scams originating from text messages. With Americans losing over $16.6 billion to online scams last year, including significant amounts due to text message scams, Google aims to empower users with advanced Scam Detection features. This AI detects various types of scams, including cryptocurrency, impersonation, and technical support scams, flagging approximately 2 billion suspicious messages monthly without sharing user data with Google. The challenges include identifying complex scams, like long-term investment frauds that build trust over time. Google’s technology may eventually extend to phone call protections. This initiative reflects a broader industry trend where companies are leveraging AI to combat scams and protect consumers.</p>

            <h2>Samsung Galaxy S25 review: the smallest top-tier Android left</h2>
            <p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 review highlights its position as the smallest top-tier Android smartphone, offering high performance with a flagship chip and innovative AI features. Priced at £799 ($800), it maintains a compact design with a 6.2-inch screen and solid battery life of around 37 hours, though it requires charging every other day. The S25's camera system, featuring a 50MP main lens and two additional cameras, produces quality photos but lacks a macrophotography mode and struggles occasionally with over-brightening images. Key advancements in AI include the new Gemini assistant, enhancing usability through voice commands and interaction with on-screen information, though it has reliability issues. The phone promises seven years of software updates, matching industry leaders. The review concludes that the S25 is an excellent choice for those seeking a small, powerful Android device, but notes its iterative design and limitations in battery life and camera capabilities compared to competitors.</p>
