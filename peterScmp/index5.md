First off, forget the vibe of yesterday 🙅‍♂️! US VC firm Eight Roads is looking to let go of its China-startup stocks due to rising geopolitical tensions and a slowed-down economy 🐢💰.

But, hold up! Not all rosy for Apple 🍏. Their new makeover didn’t impress the Chinese peeps who are like “uuuh, next!” 😬📱. The tech giant is facing some serious scrutiny in the world’s largest smartphone market, and it’s not looking too cute. 

And while we’re on the topic of retail, TikTok is flexing its muscle 💪💃🏼 by opening a new UK office with tons of fresh job opportunities although their US future is still under a heavy cloud! 🌧️ Let’s see how this evolves with the competition heating up! 

China is also pumping serious funding into its tech sector and getting serious about the private sector with new initiatives for startups 💼📈. Gotta love that hustle!
