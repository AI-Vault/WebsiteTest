First up, Eight Roads is looking to pull its investments in Chinese tech - like, can we not? 😩 With things heating up geopolitically and China's economy taking a *bit* of a hit, investors are kinda ghosting the scene. 🥴 But don’t worry! Local funds are stepping in to keep the dreams alive! 💪💸

Then we have Alibaba's boss, Joe Tsai, spilling the beans on open-sourcing large language models (LLMs)!! 🤯💬 This move could spark a flood of AI apps - can you say APP-ocalypse?! 🌊📱 It’s all about making AI accessible and boosting cloud computing! #CloudBae
