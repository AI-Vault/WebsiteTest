        <p>Microsoft is discontinuing its Bing Search APIs, which previously provided search data to smaller rivals and developers, signaling a strategic shift towards AI-driven chatbot solutions. This decision, effective August 11, comes as Microsoft aims to meet market demand for AI technologies, despite raising API costs significantly in recent years, which led many to stop using the service. Larger clients, such as DuckDuckGo, will retain access, while smaller developers face early cutoffs. The move reflects intense competition in the search engine market, exacerbated by the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and ongoing antitrust scrutiny of Google. Developers express concerns that the new AI-based service lacks the depth and flexibility of the previous APIs, complicating their operations. The discontinuation could potentially lead to innovation among competing search engines that still offer similar tools. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/bing-microsoft-api-support-ending/ target="_blank">link</a></p>

        <div class="headline">The Middle East Has Entered the AI Group Chat(15-5-2025-wired)</div>
        <p>The article examines the increasing investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, particularly during Donald Trump's recent visit to the Middle East. Highlighting landmark partnerships between US tech firms and Middle Eastern nations, the deals include building significant AI datacenters and enhancing computing capacity, which reflect a strategic push to position these countries as emerging players in the global AI landscape. The alliances aim to counterbalance China's influence in the region, as both Saudi Arabia and the UAE possess substantial oil wealth and a desire to diversify their economies away from oil dependence. Additionally, the recent reversal of a Biden-era chip sales restriction further emphasizes the US's intent to maintain technological dominance. The article underscores the geopolitical implications of these partnerships, hinting at potential rivalries and concerns regarding technology transfer to China. <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/trump-middle-east-artificial-intelligence-investments/ target="_blank">link</a></p>
