Engineers use APIs while everyone else uses a chatbot. I think coders don‚Äôt take what experts can do with chatbots seriously &amp; non-tech people don‚Äôt understand building scalable AI tools. <a href=https://x.com/emollick/status/1930508633910964595 target="_blank">link</a></p> </div>

        <p>I do like these sorts of tests but wish they made it clearer that they represent the minimum bounds of AI. 

They are representative of what a naive user would experience (which is important!) but not what you could do with Gemini 2.5 Pro or o3. Backward, not forward looking. https://t.co/5NuoeYhcZm <a href=https://x.com/emollick/status/1930346576125288868 target="_blank">link</a></p> </div>

        <p>I think AI has huge educational potential, but more in-class tests is a reasonable short-term response to cheating risks.

Low-stakes testing is a powerful learning (not just assessment) tool. Tests help you remember better, access unrelated knowledge &amp; learn more in the future. https://t.co/bWreV9n2GX <a href=https://x.com/emollick/status/1929971144649568623 target="_blank">link</a></p> </div>

In a representative survey of US workers, 43.2% now use generative AI at work. They use it for 1/3 of their tasks &amp; report a tripling of productivity on those tasks. https://t.co/BXm5YJ1IjJ <a href=https://x.com/emollick/status/1929678222137901194 target="_blank">link</a></p> </div>

        <p>I've been using prompts of otters as a test of AI ability.

It has taken less than three years to go from a text prompt producing images of abstract masses of fur to producing realistic videos with sound (including "like the musical Cats but for otters‚Äù). https://t.co/heqLkyBS6U https://t.co/CG4OX0BPLZ <a href=https://x.com/emollick/status/1929612980041253132 target="_blank">link</a></p> </div>

        <p>I wrote a history of AI in 32 images of otters using wifi on airplanes, from images to video to code.

It shows two big trends: rapid improvements in AI models of all types and the growth of open weights AI models.

        <p>It turns out that most AI models (including DeepSeek r1), if told they should "follow your conscience to make the right decision," will snitch on you to the Feds if they think you are suppressing knowledge of a drug trial that actually kills people.

        <p>As someone who uses, researches, writes about &amp; teaches AI, I‚Äôm still not clear what ‚ÄúAI fluency‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI literacy‚Äù means in practice

A lot of AI knowledge is changing rapidly (eg ‚Äúprompt engineering‚Äù) or is becoming obsolete with newer models &amp; mere use feels like a low standard <a href=https://x.com/emollick/status/1928959358445949236 target="_blank">link</a></p> </div>
